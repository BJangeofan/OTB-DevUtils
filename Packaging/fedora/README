To setup rpmbuild on Fedora or RHEL. you can refer to the below centos wiki page. I had used the same setup on Fedora 21

http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment

This directory contains SPECS and SOURCES directory which can be copied directly into your rpmbuild directory
eg:
cp -r SOURCES SPECS ~/rpmbuild

You need to get all source files mentioned in the respective spec file for the package into ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ to rebuild rpms

eg otb.spec contains "Source0:       http://orfeo-toolbox.org/packages/%{_uname}-%{version}.tgz"
cd ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/
wget Source0:       http://orfeo-toolbox.org/packages/OTB-5.0.0.tgz


now run rpmbuild to build your own rpms. For various options for rpmbuild tool. Please refer to its documentation
http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm-snapshot/ch-rpm-b-command.html

cd ../SPECS

rpmbuild -ba otb.spec

After this finishes, you will have rpms in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<your-system-architeture>/

source rpms that can be uploaded to copr for rebuilding can be visible at ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
