Fedora binary packages for OTB are uploaded in FedoraCopr.

Build these rpms on your system!
===============================

1. setup rmbuild
To setup rpmbuild on Fedora or RHEL. you can refer to the below centos wiki page. I had used the same setup on Fedora 21.
http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/SetupRpmBuildEnvironment

2. copy files from DevUtils/Packaging/fedora
This directory contains SPECS and SOURCES directory which can be copied directly into your rpmbuild directory
eg:
cd DevUtils/Packaging/fedora
cp -r SOURCES SPECS ~/rpmbuild

3. Get all sources archives.
You need to get all source files mentioned in the respective spec file for the package into ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES/ to rebuild rpms.
a list of files used can be found in the file SOURCES/required_source_archives.txt

4. start build with rpmbuild

Now run rpmbuild to build your own rpms.
For various options for rpmbuild tool, Please refer to below link
http://www.rpm.org/max-rpm-snapshot/ch-rpm-b-command.html

4.1
cd ../SPECS
rpmbuild -ba otb.spec

End Note:
After this finishes, you will have rpms in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/<your-system-architeture>/
source rpms that can be uploaded to copr for rebuilding can be visible at ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
