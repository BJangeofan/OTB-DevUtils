insighttoolkit (3.20.0-4) experimental; urgency=low

  Language bindings for java, python, and tcl now use the new-style
    "WrapITK" method rather than the venerable "cswig" wrapping.  WrapITK
    has a number of advantages over cswig, as described in the paper
    http://hdl.handle.net/1926/188; however, this is a breaking change
    for all code using these languages.
