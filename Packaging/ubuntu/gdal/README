This files allow for generation of gdal packages.

Since gdal 1.8, the GTiff driver is disabled when gdal detects a TIFF conflict (internal >= 4 version, but program linked with TIFF 3).
This happens with otb as ossim is linked to libtiff.
This directory contains a patch to gdal preventing the deregistration of the GTiff driver.

Procedure for the generation of the packages :

DEVUTILS = /your/path/to/OTB-DevUtils/Packaging/ubuntu/gdal

>> Create a working dir
WORKDIR = /tmp/gdal

>> Download the source package for different distrib

for each distrib in {lucid, maverick, natty}
 > edit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntugis-ubuntugis-unstable-{yourdistrib}.list
 > edit the "src" section and use $distrib
 > cd $WORKDIR/$distrib
 > apt-get source gdal
 > cp $DEVUTILS/do_not_disable_GTIFF_for_otb $WORKDIR/$distrib/gdal-1.8.0/debian/patches
 > echo "do_not_disable_GTIFF_for_otb" >> $WORKDIR/$distrib/gdal-1.8.0/debian/patches/series

>> Source packages can now be generated
 > edit $DEVUTILS/make_ubuntu_gdal_packages.sh and put the correct paths at the end
 > launch $DEVUTILS/make_ubuntu_gdal_packages.sh

>> Upload to launchpad
 > dput -P ppa-otb-nightly *.changes
