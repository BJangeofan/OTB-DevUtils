Description: Meta-package for ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) Applications
 ORFEO Toolbox (OTB) is distributed as an open source library of image
 processing algorithms. OTB is based on the medical image processing library
 ITK and offers particular functionalities for remote sensing image processing
 in general and for high spatial resolution images in particular. OTB is
 distributed under a free software license CeCILL (similar to GNU GPL) to
 encourage contribution from users and to promote reproducible research.
 .
 OTB Applications are a set of various command line interface (CLI) and
 graphical interface (GUI) applications developped around the OTB library.
 .
 This package is a meta-package. It depends on all CLI an GUI applications and
 libraries provided by OTB Applications.
