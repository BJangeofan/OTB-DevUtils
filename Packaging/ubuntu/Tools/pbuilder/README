PBuilder configuration files used fot OTB packages.

* pbuilderrc.ppa

  This configuration file must be used to build applications (like Monteverdi,
  OTB-Applications, OTB-Wrapping, ...) with an official OTB library package,
  downloaded from the public OTB Launchpad PPA.

  Examples:

  # builder create \
      --configfile /root/pbuilderrc.ppa

  # pbuilder login --save-after-login \
      --configfile /root/pbuilderrc.ppa

  # pbuilder update \
      --configfile /root/pbuilderrc.ppa

  # pbuilder build \
      --configfile /root/pbuilderrc.ppa \
      /tmp/monteverdi_1.6.0-0ppa~lucid4.dsc

* pbuilderrc.local

  This configuration file must be used to build applications (like Monteverdi,
  OTB-Applications, OTB-Wrapping, ...) with an experimental OTB library
  package, downloaded from a local Debian repository.

Both configurations could be used to build an OTB library package (because no
other OTB package is needed).

The BINDMOUNTS variable defined in these files lists directories from the
native system that pbuilder must "bind mount", with the same path, in the
chroot environment. This feature is more particularly useful to:
- give access from the chroot environment to the local Debian repository,
- share local files needed by the chroot environment (like GPG public keys).
