which parts are mine and which parts are modified.

For a substantially modified version, simply note that it is, in part,

4. The kbool library does polygon boolean operation and is used by the
ossimPolyArea2d class. The license terms are based on the wxwidgets
licensing which gives free use in commercial and non-commercial
libraries. At the time of download the module used could be found at:
http://boolean.klaasholwerda.nl/download/download.html

5. Geotrans. The geotrans library is a set of map projections that are
certified and hosted by NGA. They give free use in commercial and non
commercial software packages and at the time of download the geotrans
modules could be found at http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/geotrans/. We
have embedded the datum, ellipsoid, and map projections into the ossim
baseline and wrapped in C++ classes so to remove the global variable
access common in the raw getorans c library.
